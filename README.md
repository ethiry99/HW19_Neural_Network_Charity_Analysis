# HW 19 Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview of the Project
* #### Use nueral networks to predict success of charity proposals
* #### Create bianary classifier to make the prediction using .csv dataset provided by Alphabet Soup.

## Results
### Data Preprocessing Questions
1)  What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
2)  What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
3) What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
4)  How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
5) How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
6) What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary


Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
